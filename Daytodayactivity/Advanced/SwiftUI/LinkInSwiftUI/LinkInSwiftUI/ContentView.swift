/// A user interface control which allows the user to trigger an open
/// URL action. This control can be used to navigate outside of the app.

/// To create a Link, you provide a title (or label) and a URL as the destination.
/// Here's an example of creating a link to navigate to "apple.com":

         */

            /// and a text saying "Visit us!". Both elements have a large title font, and the whole
