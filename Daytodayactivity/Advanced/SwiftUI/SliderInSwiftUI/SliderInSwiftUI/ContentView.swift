/// A user interface control that allows for the adjustment of a value within a bounded range.
///
/// In SwiftUI, the Slider presents a track with a draggable thumb, enabling users to
/// select a value within a predefined range. It often finds application in settings,
/// controls, and configurations where a specific value, such as volume or brightness,
/// needs adjustment. The Slider interacts directly with a binding to a source of truth,
/// ensuring the selected value gets captured and reflected in real-time.
///
/// In this example, we have a Slider that allows users to adjust the volume level.
/// The current volume level, represented as a percentage, is displayed above the slider
/// and is stored in the volume property.

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var volume: Float = 1

        /// The main view content which is rendered and displayed on the screen
    var body: some View {
        /// A VStack containing a label and the Slider.
                VStack(spacing: 20) {
                    /// Display the current volume as a percentage
                   
                    //Text("Volume: \(Float(volume))")
                    Text(String(format: "volume: %.1f", volume))
