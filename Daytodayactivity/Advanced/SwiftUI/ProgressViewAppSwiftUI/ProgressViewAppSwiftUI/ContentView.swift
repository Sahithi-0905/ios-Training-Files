/// A view that displays the progress towards completion of a task.
///
/// SwiftUI's ProgressView provides a way to visually indicate the progress of a task
/// or the duration of an activity. It can be shown as both a linear progress bar
/// (determinate mode) or as a circular activity indicator (indeterminate mode).
///
/// In the example below, we illustrate both modes of ProgressView.
/// The first one displays the linear progress of a task with a bindable fraction
/// of completion, while the second one shows an indeterminate progress, usually used
/// when the duration of the task is unknown

struct ContentView: View {
    /// A bindable property that holds the fractional completion of a task (0.0 to 1.0)
    @State private var taskProgress: Double = 0
    
    @State private var progress = 0.6
    
    /// The main view content which is rendered and displayed on the screen
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            /// A VStack containing the two styles of ProgressView.
            VStack(spacing: 30) {
                /// A linear progress bar bound to the taskProgress property.
                ProgressView("Task Progress", value: taskProgress, total: 1.0)
                    .progressViewStyle(LinearProgressViewStyle(tint: Color.blue))
                
                /// A circular activity indicator for indeterminate progress.
                // ProgressView()
                
                
                ProgressView(value: taskProgress)
                Button("More") { taskProgress += 0.05 }
                
                
                ProgressView(value: progress)
