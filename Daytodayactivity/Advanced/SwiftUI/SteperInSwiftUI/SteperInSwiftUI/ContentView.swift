import SwiftUI
/// https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stepper
/// A user interface control that provides an intuitive way to adjust
/// a numerical value, typically within a predefined range.
///
/// In SwiftUI, the Stepper view allows users to increment or decrement
/// a value by tapping on the plus or minus buttons. It can work directly
/// with a binding to a value, ensuring the value changes as the stepper is adjusted.
/// Additionally, it can be combined with text or other views to describe its purpose.
///
/// In this example, we present a Stepper that lets users adjust the quantity
/// of an item. The current quantity is displayed next to the stepper.
///
